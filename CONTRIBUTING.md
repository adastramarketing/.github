# Contributing to Ad Astra


Thanks for your interest in contributing!


## Ground rules
- Open an Issue to discuss significant changes before starting.
- Use feature branches and Pull Requests (no direct pushes to `main`).
- Keep PRs small, focused, and with a clear problem statement.
- Follow code style: Prettier/ESLint (JS/TS), PSRâ€‘12 (PHP). Run linters before pushing.
- Add/update minimal docs/tests where it improves maintainability.


## Local setup
We provide reproducible environments in `/templates` (Docker + Make).
